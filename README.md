# Tonic Core

## Security Audits

Tonic is a project forked from Tornado Cash. Tornado Cash received security audits for cryptographic technology, smart contracts, and ZK-SNARK circuits through [ABDK Consulting](https://www.abdk.consulting) in November 2019. You can find their reports under [here](audit/tornado-cash/).

Given the minor changes made in this fork, which do not affect the fundamental aspects of the original project, it is not necessary to undergo another security audit. Relying on the robust security evaluations conducted for Tornado Cash is reasonable, as the core functionality remains largely unaltered.
